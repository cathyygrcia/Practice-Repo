            Welcome to Cathy's Coding Space! This is a place I created to keep
            up with my coding skills that I have gained over the past few
            months. Everthing displayed on this website was designed
            specifically for me to practice certain skills and technologies. One
            of the best and hardest decisions of my life was to quit my full
            time job to enroll in a coding bootcamp. Although it was one of the
            hardest things I have ever done, I am truly grateful to have had
            that experience. Coding has changed my life for the better and I am
            excited to embark on this new journey as a software engineer.
            Throughout this website I have created different pages displaying
            some of my hobbies and interests. Take a look around to discover
            more about me!
